# Introduction
The rapid development of deep learning techniques has revolutionized various remote sensing applications, which is especially true for change detection (CD) areas. Consequently, the past few years has seen a surge of deep learning change detection (DLCD) techniques with unparalleled improvements in precision, efficiency, and automation.  Despite their huge success, these methods often follow a data-driven routine, where massive labeled data is required to guarantee network parameters learning. However, it is costly and labor-intensive to obtain sufficient labeled data for CD task, especially pixel-level annotations. In such context, label-efficient DLCD (LE-DLCD) techniques have garnered increasing attention, which are capable of training CD networks with incomplete labels, inexact labels or even no explicit labels.  In this review, we conducted a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art label-efficient DLCD methods, which are categorized into six schemes of semi-supervised CD, weakly-supervised CD, self-supervised CD, active learning CD, few-shot CD, and unsupervised CD. Subsequently, each scheme is further categorized into finer subcategories for in-depth summarization and analysis. Next, we make systematic quantitative comparisons of typical LE-DLCD methods to provide valuable guidance for real-world scenarios. Finally, the challenges and future directions of LE-DLCD are presented in detail, which aims to shed lights and inspirations on this area for CD community.
